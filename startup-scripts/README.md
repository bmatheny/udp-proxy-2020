# Startup Scripts

Since UDP Proxy 2020 tends to run on non-standard hardware (firewalls mostly)
I'm creating a collection of startup scripts for different platforms to
make it easier to auto-start the program on boot.

 * [pfSense](pfSense) - Used for pfSense and probably many BSD-based operating systems
 * [Ubiquiti Dream Machine/Dream Machine Pro/UXG-Pro](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities) - Use UDM Utilities (or [UXG-Pro Utilities](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/uxg-boot)
 * [Docker](Docker) - Use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run udp-proxy-2020
 * [systemd](systemd) - Generic Linux [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd) config for most distros
